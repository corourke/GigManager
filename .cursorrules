# Cursor Rules for GigManager project

## Application Context
**Gig Manager** is a production and event management platform used by:

- Production companies managing events and performances
- Sound and lighting companies tracking equipment and staff
- Event producers coordinating venues, acts, and logistics

## Database Changes
- All database schema changes (DDL statements) that build on `supabase/schema.sql` must be created as migration files in `supabase/migrations/`
- Migration files should be named with a timestamp prefix: `YYYYMMDDHHMM_description.sql`
- After creating a migration file, also update `supabase/schema.sql` to keep it in sync
- Provide instructions for applying migrations in Supabase SQL Editor when needed


## UI guidelines

* Don't create separate components for Add and Update screens, use one form component with logic to correctly handle both Create and Update operations. 
* Only use absolute positioning when necessary. Opt for responsive and well structured layouts that use flexbox and grid by default.
* Refactor code as you go to keep code clean.
* Keep file sizes small and put helper functions and components in their own files.

### Tables and Lists

* **Use auto table layout** - Never use `table-layout: fixed` on tables. Use the default auto layout to allow columns to adapt to content naturally.
* **Use min-width instead of fixed widths** - Set `min-width` values on table columns to prevent collapsing, but allow columns to expand beyond the minimum to accommodate content. Avoid fixed `width` values that force rigid column sizes.
* **Allow text wrapping** - Override default `whitespace-nowrap` behavior by adding `whitespace-normal` to table headers and cells. This prevents column overlap by allowing text to wrap when space is constrained.
* **Prevent column collapse** - Set appropriate `min-width` values on columns that should maintain a minimum size (e.g., Title column should have `min-w-[200px]` to prevent collapsing on narrow screens).
* **Use overflow-x-auto wrapper** - Wrap tables in a container with `overflow-x-auto` to enable horizontal scrolling when content exceeds viewport width, rather than forcing columns to overlap.
* **Let content determine width** - Columns should size based on their content first, then respect minimum widths, allowing the table to expand naturally while maintaining readability.

## Data handling guidelines

* When updating data in the database through a user edit action (whether on a form, or inline editing
  in a table) ensure that we ONLY update database columns (including rows in related tables) for 
  values that have been changed in the UI. We should not make changes to column values that have not 
  changed to avoid triggering change logic in the back-end.
* It is not necessary to include code to gracefully handle the case where a table 
  doesn't exist as we will always assume that migrations will be run. 
* Do not add or maintain any code to handle mock data -- we are using a live database. 

## Coding Principles

### 1. Type Safety First

- **Prefer TypeScript with strict mode enabled**

### 2. Organization Context

- **Every API route must verify user membership** in the organization
- **Every database query must filter by `organization_id`** (enforced by RLS)
- **Use middleware or helper functions** to extract and validate organization context
- **Default to rejecting access** if organization membership cannot be verified
- **Never trust client-provided organization IDs** without server-side verification

### 3. Error Handling

- **Always use standardized error responses** consistent across the application
- Always catch and handle errors gracefully
- Log errors server-side for debugging
- Return user-friendly error messages (don't expose internal details)
- Use specific error codes for different error types
- Include validation details in `details` field for form validation errors

### 4. Database Access

- **Always include `organization_id` in WHERE clauses** for tenant-scoped queries
- **Use transactions for multi-step operations** that must be atomic
- Ensure referential integrity
- Use UUIDs for all primary keys
- Timestamps use server-side defaults

### 5. Security

- **Never trust client input** - always validate on the server
- **Verify authentication** before any protected operation
- **Verify authorization** (organization membership, role) before sensitive operations
- **Sanitize user input** before displaying (React handles this by default, but be careful with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`)
- **Use HTTPS in production**
- **Never expose sensitive data** in error messages or logs

### 6. Performance

- **Use database indexes** for frequently queried fields
- **Implement pagination** for large result sets
- **Use `select` to limit fields** returned from database when possible
- **Cache frequently accessed data** when appropriate
- **Use React Server Components by default** (App Router)

### 7. Maintainability

- **Write self-documenting code** with clear variable and function names
- **Extract reusable logic** into utility functions
- **Keep functions focused** on a single responsibility
- **Add comments for complex business logic**
- Only use absolute positioning when necessary. Opt for responsive and well structured layouts that use flexbox and grid by default
- Refactor code as you go to keep code clean
- **Keep components small and focused** -- Keep file sizes small and put helper functions and components in their own files.
