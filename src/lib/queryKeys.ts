/**
 * Centralized React Query key conventions (Phase 7, Step 2).
 *
 * Keys are hierarchical so related caches can be invalidated together:
 *   queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: queryKeys.team(orgId) })
 *
 * Convention: list keys are scoped by the org (or parent) id; detail keys by
 * the entity id. Services remain the single Supabase access layer — these keys
 * only identify cache entries; the query functions call the services.
