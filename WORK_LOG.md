# Work Log

History of what shipped and how the board got here. **Not current work**: that is [WORK_PLAN.md](./WORK_PLAN.md).
Append new entries at the top of each section; never edit an old entry to describe a later state.

## Shipped (newest first)

- **PR #302** (Docs Lead, merged 10-24 with Cameron's OK): user guide for #186 steps 3–4, covering the phone's Send to Maintenance (location, expected back, how many, To maintenance, Add more, undo), the Locations override's Sending to maintenance, the In maintenance / Flagged to maintenance tags, the packing-list note, and the full-width Maintenance screenshot.

- **#20 batch 9** (#310, Equipment Lead; merged 10-24 by the coordinator on review): the mobile `inventoryTracking`, `offlineSync`, `orgIndex` and `packingList` services onto the data-access base. With it, no service calls `createClient()`/`requireAuth()` directly. (Its docs-site check failed instantly; the docs site reads none of its files.)

- **#20 batch 6** (#309, Equipment Lead; merged 10-24 by the coordinator on review): `gig` and the mobile staff dashboard onto the data-access base; `gigService.shared` keeps only the activity-context helpers. Characterization tests added first (child-gig count, staff dashboard load).

- **Prod deploy, 10-23** (Cameron): #299 and #303 (#186 steps 3–4, phone and desktop Maintenance), plus #20 batches 3–5, 7 and 8 (#304–#308, no visible change). Coordinator verified read-only: build `index-Z2NDBOsm.js` (built 22:46 UTC) carries the phone's MAINTENANCE_SEND and the override's "Send to maintenance"; migrations unchanged at `20261022000000`; `/sw.js` no-cache.

- **#20 batches 3, 4, 5, 7, 8** (Equipment Lead; merged 10-23 by the coordinator under Cameron's 10-23 OK for pure-refactor batches): #304 `gigStaff`/`asset`/`kit` (shared `computeFieldChanges` in `src/utils/fieldChanges.ts`), #305 `organization`/`conflictDetection`/`googleCalendar`, #306 `inventoryManagement`/`gigFinancial`/`taxReport`, #307 `purchase`, #308 `equipmentItem`/`equipmentNeeds`/`writeOff`/`maintenance`. No behaviour change; tested combined: 2337 tests, tsc, eslint.

- **PR #303** (Equipment Lead, merged 10-23 with Cameron's OK): #186 step 4. The desktop override's Mark for Maintenance now sends (with gig: flagged until home); Locations, the where-is-it card, the Item page and the web packing list show "in maintenance · <location>" and "flagged to maintenance"; old "Maintenance" tracking rows are ignored; #300 (Maintenance table too wide) fixed. No migration. **#186, #300 and #162 closed 10-23.** #20 unpaused.
- **Repo renamed** GigManager → GigWrangler (Cameron, 10-23). GitHub redirects old URLs; the coordinator attached the new name to its session, and the Leads re-subscribe their PRs under it.

- **PR #299** (Equipment Lead, merged 10-23 with Cameron's OK): #186 step 3, the phone. Send to Maintenance takes a location, an expected-back date and How many for a lot. A flagged item shows "To maintenance"; Add more works at the flag's own gig. Unticking cancels the flag or returns the item to service. Three new queued types (MAINTENANCE_SEND/RETURN/UPDATE); older phones' ASSET_STATUS_UPDATE is unchanged. "Any" lines skip lots in Maintenance and Inactive lots (Cameron, 10-22). No migration.
- **PR #301** (Docs Lead, merged 10-23): the user guide's Equipment › Maintenance section and fixes on 6 related pages, matching prod after steps 1–2. **PR #297** (triage): the user-documentation plan's status block refreshed.

- **Prod deploy, 10-22** (Cameron): #296 and #298 (#186 Maintenance steps 1–2). Coordinator verified read-only: migration level `20261022000000`; the maintenance functions and `assets_status_known` are present; prod statuses are unchanged (Active 209, Inactive 6, Returned 6, Disposed 1, none pending); build `index-B177xxiD.js` carries the new Maintenance list (InventoryTabScreen chunk); `/sw.js` serves no-cache.

- **PR #298** (Equipment Lead, merged 10-22 with Cameron's OK): #186 step 2, the services and the web Maintenance list. In maintenance and Flagged, not home yet sections; Staff+ can edit, return to service and cancel a flag; the send checks the Locations home count. No migration. One review round: the merge prediction now matches the database, a failed load shows an error, undated records sort last.

- **PR #296** (Equipment Lead, merged 10-22 with Cameron's OK): #186 step 1, the Maintenance database. It adds send, edit and return to service; pending until home; part of a lot splits off and merges back; a flag is cleared when the record is disposed or retired; a 2nd flag at the same gig adds to the first (Cameron 10-22); 5 history events. Migration `20261022000000` was applied to dev 10-22; prod gets it at the next deploy. Three review rounds; RLS test 65 has 150 checks.

- **Prod deploy, 10-19** (Cameron): #295 (#183 D2 import preview). Coordinator verified read-only: migrations unchanged at `20261021000000`; build `index-N2lH3tA9.js` carries the column guide; `/sw.js` and `/version.json` serve no-cache.

- **#175** (Delete gig is offered to Managers, but Admin-only): closed 10-18 by the owner-organization plan (PRs #281, #284, #286, #289, #293), all in prod. Removed from §1 by triage 10-19.

- **PR #295** (coordinator's helper, merged 10-18 with Cameron's OK): #183 D2, the CSV import preview's summary cards (valid, invalid and held rows; items new and existing; units, lots and lines; kits) with row notes, and a grouped column guide. **#183 closed.**

- **PRs #293, #292, #294** (merged 10-17 with Cameron's OK): phone gig-list status menu limited to the owner's Admins and Managers (#175); #175 guide wording fixes; dated figures note in the tenant-isolation doc (triage).

- **PRs #289, #290** (merged 10-14 with Cameron's OK after an independent review): #175 follow-ups (participant save compares with the rows the user loaded; phone hides "+ Add" for an Inactive org) and the #175 user guide (gig owner, Delete rules, Leave Gig, Inactive).

- **PR #291** (coordinator's helper, merged 10-14 with Cameron's OK): the phone app announces new versions. A no-cache `/version.json` check runs on open, on foreground and every 30 min; Reload waits for the new worker, or says "close and reopen"; `public/_headers` asks for no-cache on `/sw.js`, `/registerSW.js` and `/version.json`.

- **Prod deploy, 10-14** (Cameron): #286 (#175 PR 3) with migration `20261021000000`. Coordinator verified read-only: migration in, new helper functions not executable by signed-in users, 0 ownerless gigs, build `index-CGoXgCqZ.js` with the Delete reason and Inactive banner. The Docs Lead is publishing the #175 guide pages.

- **PR #286** (Equipment Lead, merged 10-14 with Cameron's OK after two independent reviews): #175 PR 3 of 3. Owner shown; Delete Gig disabled with its reason (Cameron's wording); status and Duplicate owner-only; Remove right away; Leave, Mark Inactive and Reactivate (web); Inactive per Cameron's 10-13 meaning (release staff and equipment first; only financials and notes after); Gig History logs removals, leaves, Inactive and Reactivated in the database; the mobile participant-notes fix. Migration `20261021000000` on dev; prod at the next deploy.

- **Docs PRs #287, #288, #285** (merged 10-13 with Cameron's OK): Locations guide for #268, Kits guide for #282/#283, and the conflict-detection technical doc (Cancelled and Inactive skipped).

- **Prod deploy, 10-13** (Cameron): #268, #282, #283, #281 (migration `20261020000000`), #284, plus the `server` function. Coordinator verified read-only: 99/99 gigs owned with active owners, no Inactive rows, the new build's strings, `server` updated 17:26 UTC. The Docs Lead is publishing the held Locations and Kits pages.

- **PR #284** (Equipment Lead, merged 10-13 with Cameron's OK after an independent review): #175 PR 2 of 3, services. Delete names why it's refused; remove and Inactive services check what the database did; duplicate is owner-only and leaves out Inactive participants (Cameron 10-13); calendar sync skips Inactive organizations. No migration; prod needs a `server` deploy (dev has it).

- **PR #281** (Equipment Lead, merged 10-12 with Cameron's OK after two independent reviews): #175 PR 1 of 3. Every gig has an owner organization; delete, status, owner and parent-gig changes are owner-only; participations can be marked Inactive (read-only on shared details, the schedule and other organizations' contacts). Participant saves now fail clearly when a change is refused. The legacy gig-delete server route is removed. Migration `20261020000000` applied to dev 10-12 (17/17 gigs owned); prod needs it plus a `server` deploy. Prod backfill dry run: 99/99.

- **PRs #282, #283** (coordinator's helper, merged 10-12 with Cameron's OK): fix #278 (the kit list's Tracking Status count was meaningless; it now uses the gig packing-list count, the badge plus "N of M") and #279 (Kit Contents cells wrap so Total Value and the X fit). Failing tests first; no migrations. **PR #280** (Docs Lead): Kits page.

- **PR #268** (Equipment Lead, merged 10-12 with Cameron's OK after three independent reviews): Locations Item filter, piece counts, "2 of 10" rows, the where-is-it card, Move N of a lot in Manual Tracking Override (fixes #160; the target row is written after the closing return; one stale rule; capped at the lot), and parts of a lot leaving a case get a warning. **PR #277** (Docs Lead): user-guide pages for the 10-12 deploy.

- **Prod deploy, 10-12** (Cameron): #263, #264, #267, #269, #270, #271, #272, #273, #276 (no migrations). The coordinator verified the served build's strings read-only; migrations are unchanged at 20261019000000. The Blue Valley duplicate payment was cleaned up by Cameron in the app.

- **10-12 merges, round 2** (Cameron's OK, after coordinator review): **#276** (#183 D, CSV import onto units, lots and kit lines; independent review found the row-grouping, retired-status, retry and preview-crash problems, all fixed with failing tests first), **#269** (Equipment Lead; #265 container still out at another gig; the review's repeat-warning finding fixed), **#275** (Docs Lead; Payment received → Apply to).

- **10-12 merges** (with Cameron's OK, after coordinator review): **#267** (Equipment Lead; fixes #245, #249: contents wrap and indent, partly packed lot "N of M", Columns remembered per browser and used for print, header "N kits · M pieces"); **#270** (Equipment Lead; #242 items 5, 7: Undo write-off on the equipment page, "asks for 6, lot has 4"); **#271** (helper; #175 stopgap, Delete gig for Admins only); **#272** (helper; fixes #256, scanner manual entry inside the desktop dialog); **#273** (helper; #266 items 1–4, kit page). Each had a failing test first; no migrations.

- **PR #264** (coordinator, merged 10-11 with Cameron's OK): the open app checks for a new version on returning to the foreground and every 30 min, and shows "A new version of GigWrangler is ready." with Reload (never reloads by itself). Failing test first.

- **Open-issue audit** (coordinator, 10-11, Cameron's OK): closed #184 (kit editor, overlap; #225, #230, #236, #238), #185 (packing list, phone scanning; #239, #240, #246), #226 (released items #233, #237, #248/#251, #252; parked items to WORK_PLAN §5) and #174 (#199; item 4 in §5). Filed #265 (container still out at another gig) and #266 (kit-page follow-ups).

- **PR #263** (coordinator, merged 10-11 with Cameron's OK): mobile transactions name rows Booking / Expense and show the desktop stage text ("Accepted, payment due", "Paid Oct 11"); rowName/stageText shared in financials/format.ts. Failing test first.

- **PR #262** (coordinator, merged 10-11; Cameron's report): Payment received on a gig with an open booking (mobile and desktop) pays that booking off via "Apply to" instead of adding a second paid row; "Separate payment (no booking)" keeps the old behaviour; a short payment asks still owed / not coming. Failing test first.

- **PR #261** (Docs Lead, merged 10-11): screenshot script keeps the seeded Last Login times (restored via dev SQL) and no longer waits for a named gig on the dashboard shot.

- **#181 (Equipment items: data grouping review for Cameron)** (closed by Cameron 10-08): the grouping was reviewed and fixed before the #180 migration ran on prod. Triage removed the stale §1 row 10-11.

- **User guide, PR #259** (Docs Lead, merged 10-11): published Scanning equipment on your phone and Adding equipment at pack-out (#246, live 10-11).

- **PRs #258 and #260** (coordinator, merged 10-11; Cameron's report after the 10-11 deploy): on Locations, an untagged item shows in no more places than it has pieces (each record's quantity now read), and an untagged item inside a container is one place per case (newest across gigs). Fixes SndEng Case and Stage Snakes showing in two places. Docs Lead tested on dev (pass @ cd98ef8).

- **Prod deploy, 10-11** (Cameron): #246, #250, #251, #252, #253, #254, #257 + migration 20261019000000 (pack-out additions). Coordinator verified read-only: prod at 20261019000000; `gig_kit_assignments.added_at_pack_out` boolean not null default false; `update_asset_status` and `user_is_staff_or_above_of_org` SECURITY DEFINER with search_path pinned; the pack-out INSERT/DELETE policies present; new build served (`/static/index-CzmUKkKx.js`), `/static/nope.js` → 404, `/gigs` and `/equipment/locations` → 200.

- **#185 PR 2, PR #246** (Equipment Lead, merged 10-11 after Cameron's branch test on dev): phone counts lots and "any" lines; ad-hoc adds at Pack-Out and Load Truck (Staff+), no swap; notes always append one row carrying the last status (kit notes write one kit row only; lines never inherit a kit row); Send to Maintenance; note popup lines and button row; migration 20261019000000 (dev applied; prod at next deploy).

- **PR #257** (coordinator, merged 10-11): fixes #255. On Locations, a lot's pieces that came home show once (its newest return), and a container's contents that sit apart from the case list in full under a "Contents" heading instead of one item becoming a second case heading. Docs Lead tested on dev (pass @ e659aa6).

- **User guide, PR #250** (Docs Lead, merged 10-10): published Assigning equipment to a gig and Inventory reports (packing list), true for prod as of the 10-10 deploy.

- **PR #254** (coordinator, merged 10-10): Locations reports each item at its own newest record (Cameron: a container's newer note or override doesn't move its contents); NotificationBell test waits for the Radix menu to take clicks (CI flake).

- **PR #253** (coordinator's sub-agent, merged 10-10): Equipment → Locations shows each case, unit and lot at its newest record across gigs (Cameron's report: a case showed an older gig's In Transit / Car). New `currentRows()` in src/utils/locations.ts; filters applied after the newest-row pick.

- **#226 item 6, PR #252** (coordinator's sub-agent, merged 10-10): a purchase line that is tracked and expensed needs an expense category before Save (filed years exempt).

- **PR #251** (coordinator's sub-agent, merged 10-10): #248 follow-up. The $0-total guard skips filed years, "Use $X" keeps line costs, and the message replaces the Mismatch banner.

- **Prod deploy, 10-10 ~16:00 UTC** (Cameron): #247 (missing build files 404, chunk self-repair) and #248 ($0 invoice total guard). No migrations; prod at 20261018000000. Coordinator verified read-only: `/static/nope.js` → 404, `/gigs` and `/assets/new` → 200, entry script served from `/static/`.

- **PR #248** (triage, merged 10-10): #226 item 5, Save blocked on a $0 invoice total over costed lines, with "Use $X". Follow-up fix in #251.

- **#246 redesign (Cameron, 10-10):** the swap (scan an unlisted unit → "Swap for #X", auto In Warehouse row for the listed one) was rejected: the app can't know which unit is being replaced, and it made up a record. Interchangeable gear uses "any N" kit lines (already supported, #162); specific-tag kits are adjusted by the operator step by step; no auto records.

- **PR #247** (coordinator's sub-agent, merged 10-10): missing build files return a real 404 (build output moved from /assets/ to /static/, Cameron's choice; `public/static/404.html`; the no-op `_redirects` removed); the app self-repairs once on a chunk-load error (clears caches, unregisters the service worker, reloads); `deploy_prod.sh` checks every deployed JS/CSS file and that a missing one gets 404. Fixes the ItemDetailScreen chunk error Cameron hit after the 10-10 deploy (the SPA HTML had been cached under the chunk URL for 4 h). **Needs a prod deploy.**

- **#185 PR 1b, PR #240** (Equipment Lead, merged 10-10): web packing list with "any" lines, counted lines, lot sizes, container contents, pieces summary, print blanks; packed counts from the shared location rule; Holds column.

- **PR #244** (coordinator's sub-agents, merged 10-10): Status and Location columns on the gig's Equipment table (Cameron 10-09; off by default, counts from the packing list); #242 items 1–4 (History labels for write-offs, confirm before Write off, Missing records' retired date and disposal amount locked, honest filed-year wording).

- **User guide, PR #241** (Docs Lead, merged 10-10): Equipment overview uses items, units and lots; gig Equipment tab lists Equipment needed.

- **Prod deploy, 10-10 ~05:00 UTC** (Cameron): #239, #240, #241, #244 + migration 20261018000000 (write-offs). Coordinator verified read-only: prod at 20261018000000, write-off functions and columns present, `update_asset_status` search_path pinned, new build served. Pre-checks were clean. Cameron saw one chunk-load error (ItemDetailScreen) right after the deploy; the chunk served correctly minutes later (CDN propagation). User guide #243 merged after the deploy.

- **#185 PR 1, PR #239** (Equipment Lead, merged 10-09): write off missing equipment (whole or part of a lot, disposal with no proceeds, undo unless the tax year is filed), the gig's Not returned list, Missing out of owned/available/insured, Disposals by record; tracking rows reference their own organization's equipment; status changes into or out of retired statuses follow the write-off rules. **Migration 20261018000000 on dev; prod with the next deploy (Cameron).**

- **Prod deploy, 10-09 ~20:30 UTC** (Cameron): #225, #228, #230, #232, #233, #236, #237, #238 (plus #231, #234, no prod effect). No migrations; prod at 20261017000000. Coordinator verified: new code-split build served (entry 839 KB), Equipment needed table, Needs attention present. Caveat until #240: "N × any" kit lines count in conflicts but aren't on packing lists.

- **User guide, PR #235** (Docs Lead, merged after the prod deploy): per-item conflicts and same-unit rule, Schedule C and Needs attention, manager-only URLs.

- **#238** (Equipment Lead, merged 10-09): same-unit conflicts list only tracked units; a container kit booked on two overlapping gigs counts as one shared unit.

- **#231 shared location rule and #236 overlap follow-ups** (Equipment Lead, merged 10-09): where a unit or lot is (append-only history, lot count summed per gig and kit, ties broken like `compareTrackingRecords`); "in containers" counts every piece again, gig-day heading for UTC+12, every short pair reported, batch same-unit check scoped to the organization.

- **#226 item 3, PR #237** (triage, merged 10-09): clearing a money field on the unit edit page saves null.

- **Demo seed, PR #234** (Docs Lead, merged 10-09): recovery periods on every depreciated unit, mileage at the IRS rate, two Needs attention examples.

- **#184 PR 2, PR #230** (Equipment Lead, merged by the coordinator 10-09): per-item overlap check: "any" lines and specific units count toward their item across overlapping gigs; needed = peak concurrent demand; free = Active, not retired, not in a container; Equipment needed table on the gig's Equipment tab; conflict wording names the item, needed, available and short; gig timezone used for the check. Two review rounds (peak vs sum, empty batch entries, container free count, org scoping, timezones, load-error line).

- **#226 item 8, PR #233** (triage, merged 10-09): Staff and Viewer opening `/assets/new`, `/assets/:id/edit` or `/financials` by URL are redirected to their landing page.

- **#125 closed: Schedule C summary and Needs attention, PR #232** (coordinator's sub-agent, merged 10-09): Schedule C rolls the Income and Expenses reports up by line (line 9 mileage shown in miles and at the IRS rate on each trip's date, counted once; Reimbursable shown below the net and not in the total); Needs attention lists missing categories, recovery periods, costs, disposal dates and invoices that don't add up, with edit links. Both have CSVs. No migration. Future: `isReconciled` compares unrounded numbers (an exact 1-cent difference reads as a mismatch).

- **User guide screenshot refresh, PR #229** (Docs Lead, merged 10-09): all 38 shots retaken for the 10-09 prod release, 14 changed.

- **User guide, PRs #224 and #227** (Docs Lead, merged 10-09): #219 follow-ups (print staff costs, Staffing-card footer shot); Financials pages caught up with the purchase rework in prod (#216, #221). TEST-221 records cleared from dev by reseeding.

- **Code-splitting PR 1, PR #228** (coordinator's sub-agent, merged 10-09): 18 remaining screens lazy-loaded; ChunkLoadBoundary ("This screen couldn't load… Reload"); landing-screen prefetch after sign-in; `npm run check:bundle` in CI (entry chunk ≤ 1.2 MB, built with a dummy Sentry DSN). Main chunk 2,043,871 → 838,807 bytes prod-shaped. Also fixes a `useAutoSave` timer leak (the 2 s "saved" reset was never cleared on unmount), which surfaced as an unhandled "window is not defined" in CI.

- **#184 PR 1, PR #225** (Equipment Lead, merged by the coordinator 10-09): kit editor and kit page support "N × any" of an item, with owned/available counts and warnings, grouped Add Components, and kit totals that include "any" lines. Fixes Duplicate kit dropping all lines of a kit with an "any" line; review fixes: a failed Duplicate leaves no empty copy, and kit saves check line delete/update errors. Not yet: packing lists and the overlap check ignore "any" lines (#185, #184 PR 2). Follow-ups: concurrent-edit partial writes (RPC later), nested-container availability display, unpaged item query.

- **#221 pre-merge test (Docs Lead, 10-09):** all paths passed for Admin/Manager/Staff/Viewer except one blocking bug (removing a depreciated line's first unit), fixed before merge; no missing-column errors anywhere. Its "can follow" items, with the coordinator's review notes, are filed as #226. Settled 3d entries removed: the Docs Lead's 10-08 queue (all done), "N × any" gaps (passed to the Equipment Lead for #184/#185), and the membership correction (parked per §2).

- **Prod deploy (10-09, Cameron, `deploy_prod.sh`; verified read-only by the coordinator):** main through PR #221. Migrations `20261016000000_staff_rate_unit` and `20261017000000_purchase_line_units` applied (all 5 prod assignments have a rate_unit; new purchase functions executable by authenticated only, the internal helper by no API role). Edge functions unchanged (server v33, ai-scan v21, health-check v3). Live bundle carries rate units, the #213 estimate, `create_purchase_transaction_v2`, the prod Supabase ref only, and a Sentry DSN. Main bundle 2,043,982 bytes.

- **#183 pieces B and C, PR #221** (Equipment Lead, merged by the coordinator 10-09): shared equipment form sections (What it is / Unit or lot / Insurance) for Add Item, Add unit or lot and the purchase Equipment details pop-up; new purchases save via `create_purchase_transaction_v2` (a line of N units = N records; fixes the prod "serial on a line of 2" error); saved lines add units, or remove them with Delete / Mark Inactive (Cameron 10-09), re-pointing `asset_id` first; Unit/Lot locked once saved; per-unit values kept. Two review rounds (coordinator) and a pre-merge dev test (Docs Lead) found and fixed 4 blocking issues. Future considerations in the PR: no rollback across a multi-step save (RPC later), no org-wide duplicate-tag warning, Track as equipment and CSV import still on v1.

- **#219, PR #223** (coordinator's sub-agent, merged 10-09): the printed sheet's Staff costs rows use the #213 estimate and add up to its summary; `money()` shows cents with two decimals ("$1,582.50"); the edit-mode staffing footer uses en-US grouping.

- **User guide published, PR #222** (Docs Lead, merged 10-09, Cameron's OK): 13 Gigs, Team and Reference pages and the glossary; links to held Equipment/Mobile pages left as plain text.

- **User guide for #213, PR #220** (Docs Lead, merged 10-09): staffing and gig-expenses pages describe the projected estimate; staffing shots retaken (the view card's footer is left out until #219).

- **Dev deploy (10-08, 23:58 UTC, coordinator):** main `571b636` (through PR #218) to dev. No migrations pending (dev matches the repo through `20261017000000`); functions server v46, ai-scan v34, health-check v6 via `functions deploy --use-api`. `supabase db push` hangs in the coordinator's cloud environment (no direct DB connection), so `deploy_dev.sh` stops there; when migrations are pending, Cameron applies them or the CLI runs where the DB port is reachable.

- **#213, PR #218** (coordinator's sub-agent, merged 10-08): a booked, unfinalized rate projects rate × units estimated from the gig (hours start→end to the nearest ¼ hr; days in the gig's timezone, an end before 06:00 counting to the day before; one half day per day), via `src/utils/rateEstimate.ts`, in the staffing footer, view-mode staffing table, Financials → Projected staff costs, money summary, print sheet and Gig Accounting ("est. 9.5 hr × $35.00 / hr = $332.50"). Same PR: the dev env file is named `.env.development.local` in `info.tsx`, the screenshots README and setup-guide. Future considerations: the gig CSV export (`getGigExportAggregates` costOfStaff) still counts each rate once; the Financials tab doesn't refetch after the gig's times change on the page.

- **#183 piece A, PR #216** (Equipment Lead, merged by the coordinator 10-08): migration `20261017000000_purchase_line_units` (on dev, applied by Cameron): `create_purchase_transaction_v2` and `add_purchase_line_units` make one record per unit (or one lot) linked by `purchase_line_id`; depreciation and recovery period follow each unit's own line; `purchases.asset_id` stays as the "tracked" marker; v1 kept for old builds. RLS test 51; mockups 3 and 4 updated. No screen uses it yet (pieces B, C, D).

- **User guide for #206, PR #217** (Docs Lead, merged 10-08): Edit on a member's page changes their role.

- **#206, PR #215** (coordinator's sub-agent, merged 10-08): a member's details page **Edit** now shows **Organization Role**, following `canAssignRole` like Team → Edit Permissions; test first.

- **User guide, PRs #207, #209–#212** (Docs Lead, merged 10-08): pages edited by #197–#201 verified (six fixes) with new dashboard, conflict-banner and Grey zone shots (#207); Financials → Reporting written (#209) and published (#211); demo seed reworked for equipment items (#210, dev reseeded); onboarding and invitations cover the email-link screens, with Cameron's hand-taken shots (#212).

- **Dev email flows (10-08):** invitation, sign-up confirmation (Confirm email now on in dev and prod) and password reset all arrive in Mailtrap and their links work (Docs Lead ran them, Cameron confirmed). Dev `site_url` and redirect list are `http://localhost:3000` only, so dev email links open localhost.

- **Deployment docs, PR #208** (coordinator's sub-agent, merged 10-08): `VITE_*` build values (incl. `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`) come from `.env.production.local` on the machine running `deploy_prod.sh`; Cloudflare dashboard env vars are not used (direct upload). The prod bundle had no Sentry DSN for that reason; Cameron to add it locally before the held deploy.

- **Coordinator handover (10-08 evening):** new coordinator session `session_01XTmXKhviMSkyy5PqcRAfUn` (Supabase Prod env, prod read-only). Routine `trig_013iEPNzrK1NR8j2Qih9jzJy` replaces `trig_01JWAcm3QHRpyaQXGNVA8w8m` (disabled, not deleted). Start-up checks passed: both tokens scoped to one project each; prod at `20261015000000`; dev at `20261016000000` (applied 10-08); 1,436 unit tests, lint (0 errors), build (main bundle 1,946,151 bytes), RLS suite incl. 49 and 50.

- **#171, PR #205** (coordinator's sub-agent, merged by Cameron 10-08): each staff rate stores its time unit (`rate_unit`: hour / day / half_day, default hour; migration `20261016000000`, which also adds `rate_unit` to the staff self-edit guard). Editor picker, Finalize asks hours/days/half days, Staffing card and print sheet show the unit.

- **Prod deploy (10-08, Cameron):** main through PR #204 (frontend and `server` v33, 15:32 UTC; no new migrations). #92 checked on dev first. **F1 run on prod:** 19 mileage rows repriced, $882.90 → $982.32, notes updated (verified read-only).

- **#20 batch 2, PR #204** (coordinator's sub-agent, merged 10-08): activityLog, gigKit, gigParticipant, gigParticipantContacts, gigSchedule on `base/dataAccess.ts`; no behaviour change; 8 new tests.

- **#20 batch 1, PR #203** (triage, merged 10-08): `notification`, `taxYear`, `accessRequest`, `purchaseScanQueue`, `purchaseCategory` now use `getSupabase` / `getCurrentUser` from the data-access base; new tests for `taxYear`, `accessRequest`, `notification`. Issue stays open (batches 2–7).

- **#182, PR #192** (Equipment Lead, merged by the coordinator 10-08): Equipment › Items tab (one row per item, units and lots beneath, Every unit & lot toggle), item page, unit/lot form; screens lazy-loaded, default 2 MiB cache limit kept.

- **#125 mileage rates, PR #202** (coordinator's sub-agent, merged 10-08 evening): date-ranged IRS rates (2023 65.5¢ … 2026-07-01 76¢), priced by the trip's date; F1 SQL for the 19 existing rows posted on #125 for Cameron.

- **#125 Grey zone report, PR #201** (coordinator's sub-agent, merged 10-08 evening): Financials → Reporting → Grey zone lists equipment lines costing $200–$2,500 each in the year with their treatment; Change… opens the purchase editor in unlocked years; CSV.

- **#92, PR #200** (coordinator's sub-agent, merged 10-08 evening): autosave in participants, schedule, staff, gig kits and kit components deletes only rows the form loaded and the user removed (`useRowBaseline`; services take `loadedIds`, nothing deleted without it); inserted rows' ids are written back. Deletes and inserts are still not one transaction.

- **PR #199** (coordinator's sub-agent, merged 10-08 evening): #174 frontend: Managers aren't offered Admin anywhere (shared `canAssignRole`), an Admin's role is read-only for Managers, your own role cell is read-only, a failed invite email no longer says "Invitation sent!". Left open: the database function's wrong tab name (needs a migration).

- **PR #198** (coordinator's sub-agents, merged 10-08 evening): #158, #159, #168, #169 (with `remark-breaks`: 13 of 19 prod notes use single line breaks), #170, #171 (delete confirmation only), #173 (incl. the server dropping timezone), #176, #188, #193 (screens on demand: main bundle 2,097,245 → 1,949,126 bytes), #194, and overnight gigs on Google Calendar. `server` deployed to dev (v42). Also merged 10-08: PR #197 (Gig Accounting: Booked; Owed to you on Completed gigs only) and PR #190 (Equipment Lead, #157 dashboard total; `server` on dev v41).

- **Prod deploy (10-08 evening, Cameron):** main at PR #196, with migration `20261015000000` (#178 person and organization search) and the `npm audit fix` lockfile (PR #196). Verified read-only: `search_people` and `search_organizations` exist, `search_users_secure` is gone.

- **#178, PR #195** (coordinator, merged 10-08): person search (`search_people`) matches every word in any order with a typo forgiven, email as typed and phone ignoring formatting, and returns only the picker's fields; organization search matches the same way. Migration `20261015000000` on dev (Cameron tested); prod waiting. Also: a `node_modules` symlink committed to main in cfdbd5e was removed in 6759f7b, and `.gitignore` now ignores it in any form.

- **PR #189 and PR #191** (Docs Lead, merged 10-08 by the coordinator with Cameron's go): Settings, Google Calendar, home page, organizations and access-request docs checked against the app with new screenshots; the Reporting page (draft); the demo seed runs on the 20261012–14 schema and seeds a moderator, a claim request and notifications.

## Triage run notes (09-23 to 10-07)

**Where things stand.** 09-28: PRs #83 (#69) and #85 (#74) merged ~14:31 UTC; both issues closed.
Urgent bug #84 approved by Cameron and fixed by the coordinator in PR #87 (merged 09-28). #81 reworked in PR #86; Cameron confirmed it 09-29 and it is closed. Nothing in §3c is left unbuilt. #71 and #81 merged earlier (see §4). 09-29: #12 PR 3 merged (#89) and code-review bugs #90–#94 filed by the coordinator; security PR #95 merged (deploy waits on Cameron, §3a). 09-30: the coordinator released #90, #91, #93 and #94 in §3c; triage built all four as PRs #96–#99, merged 04:19 UTC, and merged `main` into docs PR #88 to clear its conflict. #90 and #91 need a `server` redeploy. The coordinator merged docs PR #88 and moved triage's org-delete question to §3a. §3c is empty. Later on 09-30 the coordinator filed #102 and #103 and released them, #32 and `attachment.service.ts` (#20) in §3c. The 09:00 triage run built all four: PRs #104 (#102), #105 (#32), #106 (#20) and #107 (#103), each with a plan comment on its issue, a test written first and a mutation check. Nothing in §3c is left unbuilt. 10-01: Cameron filed #109 (packing-list picker); triage found the cause and raised it in §3b, and ran the docs pass on `deployment.md` (PR #110, merged 15:03 UTC). Cameron closed #12 the same day. 10-02: Cameron filed #111 and #117 (both raised in §3b, nothing built); the docs pass covered `tech-stack.md` (PR #118). 10-03: quiet, with no new issues or replies; the docs pass covered `coding-guide.md` (PR #119). Later that day the coordinator released #109, #111 and #117. 10-04: triage built all three, each with a plan comment on its issue, tests written first and mutation checks: PRs #120 (#109), #121 (#117) and #122 (#111). Nothing in §3c is left unbuilt. No docs pass this run. 10-05: quiet for triage. #125 is new (coordinator, waiting on Cameron) and #124 is green, so there was nothing to build. The docs pass covered `SmartDataTable.md` (PR #126). 10-06: no new issues; #138 green. The §3c user-guide audit began with the getting-started section (PR #139, merged 16:43 UTC). 10-07: no open PRs at the start; #130 found closed (PR #140) and moved to §4. The gigs published pages went into PR #151 (merged 14:59 UTC).

On 09-23 every item was blocked or parked, so the run moved on to docs. Docs-only PR
[#67](https://github.com/corourke/GigManager/pull/67) refreshed `docs/development/testing.md`: suite size,
the actual Supabase mock pattern, the finished March coverage plan replaced with the gaps that remain, and a CI
section that matches `ci.yml`. A second run the same day opened docs-only PR
[#68](https://github.com/corourke/GigManager/pull/68), which corrected `setup-guide.md`. Both merged 09-23 18:20 UTC. The fixes: Node 20.19+
instead of 18, a supported Supabase CLI install, the full migration set instead of pasting only
`initial_schema.sql`, deploying both edge functions, a seed check that works, and removing the `ai-scan`
`x-diagnostic` test that was dropped in June (also fixed in `deployment.md`).

**Docs covered by triage runs:** `docs/development/testing.md` (09-23), `docs/technical/setup-guide.md`
(09-23; build and dev server tried; `supabase start` not tried because the sandbox has no Docker daemon),
`docs/README.md` (09-24, PR #70: all links resolve; indexed `gig-financials.md`, `purchases-field-mapping.md` and
`server-endpoint-inventory.md`, the last marked historical). `database.md`'s "single initialization file" line turned
out to be a dated 02-09 changelog entry, not stale. `docs/technical/database.md` body (09-25, PR #72: reconciled with every
migration through `20260919000000` — dropped status-history tables, `kit_components` rename, six new tables, new columns).
`docs/technical/server-endpoint-inventory.md` (09-29, PR #88, merged 09-30: re-pointed at `routes/`, every row checked against the
middleware; `DELETE /gigs/:id` is Admin-only; access-request and notification routes added). `docs/technical/security-scheme.md` (09-29: checked against every policy, the RLS tests and the three edge functions; the update is **held** until the §3b security entry is resolved, then document helpers, gig UPDATE/DELETE and participant write rules, the full CORS list, `requireOrgRole` options and the `health-check` gate). `docs/technical/deployment.md` (10-01, PR #110, merged 10-01: checked against both deploy scripts, `ci.yml`, `vite.config.ts`, `config.toml` and every env read; added the `rls` CI job and the health-check step to the rebuild. Scripts only `bash -n`-checked. `deploy_prod.sh` has no `--help` and starts its gates on any run, so don't run it). `docs/technical/tech-stack.md` (10-02, PR #118, merged 10-03: checked against `package.json`, `supabase/functions/`, migrations and `ci.yml`; added `health-check` and `notifications.ts`, corrected storage to the one `attachments` bucket). `docs/development/coding-guide.md` (10-03, PR #119, merged 10-03: schema section aligned with AGENTS.md rule 4 (it said to hand DDL to the SQL Editor), the `dataAccess.ts` base added, `build` added to the gates, lint debt recounted, the done `App.tsx` split retired). `docs/technical/SmartDataTable.md` (10-05, PR #126, merged 10-05: checked against `SmartDataTable.tsx`, `EditableCell.tsx` and `useTableState.ts`. Tab visits every column, there are no arrow keys, edits aren't optimistic, and widths persist. The missing props and column options were added.) Next candidate: `docs/technical/conflict-detection.md` (PR #124, which changed `conflictDetection.service.ts`, has merged).

## Docs passes by triage

Covered: `docs/development/dry-run-findings-2026-09-08.md` (10-24, dated pass-2 record, linked from `user-documentation-plan.md`; many of its P2 findings predate later fixes, but it is a self-dated snapshot, so left as is; the 09-06 record is the same kind), `docs/development/user-documentation-plan.md` (10-22, status block was a 09-09 snapshot (site "stubs", #22 open); refreshed and the rest marked as a 2026-09 snapshot, PR opened), `docs/development/hierarchical-kits-manual-test-checklist.md` (10-21, a dated pre-merge record for a merged feature and a since-reworked kit model; archived to `docs/development/.archive/`, one reference fixed), `docs/technical/financials.md` (10-20, all cited migrations, RLS tests and the conversion fixtures exist; the track_purchase_line_as_equipment note matches the code, no app caller; no changes), `docs/technical/server-endpoint-inventory.md` (10-19, all 42 rows match the route files in `supabase/functions/server/routes/`; no changes), `docs/technical/schema-verification-2026-09.md` (10-18, self-declared 2026-09-02 snapshot with its own staleness section; repo now has 73 migrations vs the 49 it cites, left as is since §9 already warns; no changes), `docs/technical/purchases-field-mapping.md` (10-17, checked against ImportScreen labels, the example CSV and `equipment_match_key`; no changes needed), `docs/technical/conflict-detection.md` (10-13, batch queries, Cancelled and Inactive rules), `docs/development/testing.md` (09-23, PR #67), `docs/technical/setup-guide.md` (09-23, PR #68), `docs/README.md` (09-24, PR #70), `docs/technical/database.md` (09-25, PR #72), `docs/technical/server-endpoint-inventory.md` (09-29, PR #88), `docs/technical/security-scheme.md` (checked 09-29; update held, see WORK_PLAN), `docs/technical/deployment.md` (10-01, PR #110), `docs/technical/tech-stack.md` (10-02, PR #118), `docs/development/coding-guide.md` (10-03, PR #119), `docs/technical/SmartDataTable.md` (10-05, PR #126), `docs/technical/gig-financials.md` (10-14: already a pointer to `financials.md`; every file named in `financials.md` still exists)), `docs/technical/purchases-assets-expenses.md` (10-16: still a pointer; every section it names exists in `financials.md`), `docs/technical/tenant-isolation-architecture.md` (10-16, PR #294: figures date-stamped; migration, route and edge-function counts had drifted).

## Settled decisions and closed threads

- **Docs Lead security findings** (10-08): the membership report and the person-search finding went to Cameron privately. The membership backstops are parked; the person search is fixed by #178 (§1).
- **Busy pace through 10-17** (10-08): Cameron asked the coordinator to keep the agents busy, checking in at least every 5 hours; a 4-hourly Routine does it.
- **2024–25 recovery periods vs the filed returns** (10-08): both years' Form 4562s put all equipment in the 7-year class (2025: $42,155, half-year; 2024: $1,838, $500 under Section 179 and $1,338 mid-quarter, bonus elected out). 2024 basis gap of $310.37 against GigWrangler accepted by Cameron: the 2024 invoices and the pre-GigWrangler spreadsheet ($1,287.70 of assets, Waves expensed) don't rebuild the return's figure. Waves plugins stay depreciated. The returns, invoices and extracts were deleted after reading.
- **Gig financials redesign** (10-04 to 10-05): done; #123 and #124 merged; migration `20261005000000` in prod (125 rows converted). The note that preceded it:
  **Financial transaction types (coordinator, 10-04; loop back when read-only DB access exists).** Cameron wants the 25 `fin_type` values radically simplified *before* the Gig Accounting report is reworked; the change also drives how the gig's Financials tab displays. Direction proposed 10-04: five types (Fee agreed, Client payment, Refund to client, Expense, Sub-contract), with paid/due carried by `paid_at` / `due_date`, and three report sections (Needs Attention, Upcoming, Settled), each gig in exactly one. Cameron says many rows lack faithful `paid_at` / `due_date`, so the mapping must come from the raw rows, not counts. Prod is readable with `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` (set 10-04; it can write, so read-only unless Cameron approves a change):
`curl -sS -X POST "https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/hqnnhtxcxedisasvtbqv/database/query/read-only" -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query":"select ... from gig_financials ..."}'`
Never call `/database/query` (the read-write endpoint), `supabase db push`, `functions deploy` or any other write without Cameron's go-ahead for that specific change. Findings 10-04: only 5 types in use (Payment Received 70, Expense Incurred 45, Informal Terms 24, Invoice Issued 4, Bid Accepted 1). Then: read every `gig_financials` row with its gig (title, status, start, end), propose the old-to-new mapping per row pattern to Cameron, then the migration and UI. Triage doesn't touch this.
- **2025 tax data** (10-05): assets matched the filed Form 4562 list; expenses matched the filed $11,977 after Excellines and Reimbursable. Data fixes applied to prod 10-05 with Cameron's go (pre-change rows in the coordinator scratchpad `backup/`); 2024 and 2025 locked in `tax_years` 10-06.
- **Deploys done** (verified in prod by migration list, 10-08): `20260929000000` (PR #95, with #90/#91's `server` redeploy), `20261002000000` (Purchases scan queue), and everything through `20261012000000`.
- **Security findings from the 09-29 `security-scheme.md` check**: reported privately to Cameron; PR #95 (09-29) tightened the membership, contact, invitation and purchase functions.
- **Dev data** (10-07, Cameron): every non-demo organization, gig, purchase, asset, activity row and test login was deleted from dev; a JSON copy is in the Docs Lead session's scratchpad.
