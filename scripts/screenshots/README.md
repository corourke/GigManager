# User guide screenshots

Retakes the screenshots in `website/docs/src/assets/screenshots/` from the **dev** demo
data, so any shot can be refreshed after the UI changes. The rules for what to shoot
and how to crop are in [`website/docs/STYLE.md`](../../website/docs/STYLE.md#screenshots).

- `shots.mjs` is the manifest: every shot, the guide page that shows it, the demo
  user who takes it, the app files it shows, and how to set up and crop the screen.
- `shoot.mjs` runs them.
- `taken.json` records, per shot, when it was last taken, at which app commit and
  with which anchor date. The script rewrites it; commit it with the PNGs.

## Setup (dev Supabase only, never production)

1. Seed the demo data: `scripts/seed-demo.sh` (see `scripts/README.md`). It creates the
   demo logins, all with the password `demo1pass`.
2. Put the dev `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and the **anon** key in `.env.development.local` at the repo root.
   Never use the service_role key.
3. Start the app: `npm run dev` (port 3000), or set `SHOT_BASE_URL`.
4. Install once: `cd scripts/screenshots && PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 npm install`.

## Run

```sh
node scripts/screenshots/shoot.mjs                         # every shot
node scripts/screenshots/shoot.mjs --only getting-started/ # one section, or one shot id
node scripts/screenshots/shoot.mjs --list                  # shot ids and their pages
```

Settings (environment variables):

| Variable | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `SHOT_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` | The app |
| `SHOT_ANCHOR` | `2026-10-07` | The browser's frozen "today". Must match the anchor the seed was run with. |
| `SHOT_CHROMIUM` | `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium` | Chromium executable |

Every shot is taken in a 1200 × 900 window at 2× scale, light theme, time zone
`America/Los_Angeles`, with the clock frozen at 10 AM on the anchor date. Each demo
user signs in once per run through the real login form.

Two things the frozen clock doesn't reach:

- **Last Login.** Signing in updates each demo user's last sign-in, which the team
  table shows. The script notes the demo users' last sign-in before anyone signs in, and
  puts it back before the team shot and at the end of the run. It does this through
  the same dev-only SQL endpoint as `seed-demo.sh`. If that endpoint isn't available,
  the run prints a note and Last Login shows the run's real times.
- **The dashboard.** Its numbers and its "Upcoming Gigs (Next 30 Days)" list come from
  the server, which uses the real date. The shot waits for whatever the list holds,
  and the list shrinks as real time passes the seeded gigs. For a full refresh, reseed
  with an anchor in the current week (`scripts/seed-demo.sh <today>`) and run with the
  same `SHOT_ANCHOR`. The seed keeps gigs on the same weekdays relative to the anchor.

## Adding a shot

1. Add an entry to `shots` in `shots.mjs`. Its `id` is `<section>/<page>-<what>` and
   becomes the PNG path. List the app files the screen comes from in `sources`.
   Crop with `target` (a Locator, or an array of them for their combined box, plus an
   optional `pad`) rather than a fixed `clip` where you can, so the crop follows the UI.
2. Run it with `--only <id>` and look at the PNG.
3. Reference it from the page, right after the text it illustrates, with alt text:
   `![What the image shows](../../../assets/screenshots/<id>.png)`.
4. Keep each PNG under about 300 KB.

## Full refresh (each production release)

Re-run the seed (optionally with a new anchor date, then pass the same `SHOT_ANCHOR`),
run every shot, review the changed PNGs, and commit them with `taken.json`.
