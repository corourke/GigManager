## Spreadsheet Import (Columns A-Z)

The system supports a comprehensive 26-column spreadsheet import for assets and expenses. The mapping follows the legacy Act4Audio format with enhanced fields.

### Source Types
- **0-Invoice**: Header row. Defines the vendor, date, and total invoice amount.
- **1-Asset**: Individual trackable equipment.
- **2-Expense**: Non-trackable expense items (shipping, tax, small parts).

### Column Mapping (A-Z)

| Col | CSV Column Name | Req? | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | `acquisition_date` | Yes | Date | YYYY-MM-DD |
| B | `source` | Yes | Enum | 0, 1, or 2 |
| C | `vendor` | Yes* | String | *Req for Header |
| D | `total_inv_amount` | Yes* | Number | *Req for Header |
| E | `payment_method` | No | String | e.g. Visa, Amex |
| F | `line_amount` | No* | Number | *Req for Item if no price |
| G | `line_cost` | No | Number | Computed if empty |
| H | `quantity` | Yes | Integer | Default: 1 |
| I | `item_price` | No | Number | Selling price |
| J | `item_cost` | No | Number | Burdened cost |
| K | `manufacturer_model` | Yes* | String | *Req for Asset |
| L | `category` | Yes* | String | e.g. Audio, Video |
| M | `sub_category` | No | String | Older sheets only: fills Type when Type is empty |
| N | `type` | No | String | e.g. Dynamic Mic |
| O | `kit` | No | String | Add to named kit |
| P | `serial_number` | No | String | |
| Q | `tag_number` | No | String | |
| R | `description` | No | String | |
| S | `insured` | No | Boolean | |
| T | `insurance_class` | No | String | |
| U | `replacement_value` | No | Number | |
| V | `retired_on` | No | Date | |
| W | `liquidation_amt` | No | Number | |
| X | `service_life` | No | Integer | Years |
| Y | `dep_method` | No | String | e.g. MACRS |
| Z | `status` | No | Enum | e.g. Active |

### Cost Allocation Logic
For each purchase group (Header + Items):
1. **Factor** = `Invoice Total / Sum(Item Price * Quantity)`.
2. **Line Cost** = `(Item Price * Quantity) * Factor`.
3. **Item Cost** = `Line Cost / Quantity`.
4. **Penny Reconciliation**: The final item's cost is adjusted so that `Sum(Line Cost) == Invoice Total`.

## Native Implementation (Edge Function) Setup

The `ai-scan` Edge Function requires an Anthropic API key to process PDFs.

### Configuration

1. **API Key**: Obtain a paid API key from the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/).
2. **Supabase Secret**: Add the key to your Supabase project:
   ```bash
   supabase secrets set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
   Alternatively, add it via the Supabase Dashboard under **Project Settings -> Edge Functions -> Secrets**.

## Demo data for user-guide screenshots (`seed-demo.sh`)

`scripts/seed-demo.sh` posts `scripts/seed-demo.sql` to the **development** Supabase project (`qcrzwsazasaojqoqxwnr`) through the Management API `database/query` endpoint (curl + jq; credentials come from your environment or proxy, the script sends no token). **Dev only:** it refuses to run for any other project ref and must never be pointed at production.

- **Idempotent.** The SQL first deletes every row belonging to the demo organizations and users (fixed UUIDs of the form `de000000-0000-4000-8000-<kind><n>`), then re-inserts. Rows without a demo UUID are never touched.
- **Pinned dates.** Every date hangs off an anchor date, the demo world's "today" (default `2026-10-07`; pass another as `./scripts/seed-demo.sh 2027-01-15` or `SEED_DEMO_ANCHOR`). Screenshots freeze the browser clock to the same date and use the `America/Los_Angeles` time zone, so Upcoming/Past and "next 30 days" don't drift. Move the anchor only for a full screenshot refresh. Gigs are placed by week and weekday, so they stay on Friday and Saturday evenings.
- **Contents.** "Demo Sound & Lighting" plus five partner orgs (Harborlight Pavilion and Cedar Hall, venues; Neon Orchard and Paper Lanterns, acts; Brightwave Events, the main client); 4 logins and 10 people without logins; 16 gigs from about 8 weeks back to 14 weeks ahead across all statuses (two of them two-day), with participants, day-of contacts, schedules, staffing and kit assignments; 26 assets, 4 kits (one nested) and last-scanned locations; 4 purchases; a gig ledger with paid, invoiced, overdue, contracted and quoted rows; and three weeks of activity history.
- **People.** First names start with the letter of their role (Admin **A**licia, Manager **M**arcus, Staff **S**ofia and the freelance crew, Viewer **V**ictor and the partner contacts), so a screenshot shows who is who. Avatars stay as initials.
- **Demo logins** (password `demo1pass`):

  | Email | Name | Role in Demo Sound & Lighting |
  |---|---|---|
  | `demo-admin@gigwrangler.test` | Alicia Hale | Admin |
  | `demo-manager@gigwrangler.test` | Marcus Reyes | Manager |
  | `demo-staff@gigwrangler.test` | Sofia Lindqvist | Staff |
  | `demo-viewer@gigwrangler.test` | Victor Okafor | Viewer |

  The `.test` addresses receive no mail, so flows that send email (invitations, sign-up confirmation, password reset) can't be completed with them yet. Screenshotting those needs a way to simulate email delivery (noted in WORK_PLAN.md §5).
- **Run:** `./scripts/seed-demo.sh` (prints per-table row counts on success).
- The SQL targets the live dev schema. If dev gains new required columns or constraints (for example migration `20261012000000` renaming `purchases.row_type` `item`/`asset` to `line`), update `seed-demo.sql` to match.
