# Seed (or re-seed) the demo data used for user-guide screenshots.
# DEV ONLY: refuses to run against any Supabase project other than the development one.
#
# Usage: scripts/seed-demo.sh [ANCHOR_DATE]
#   ANCHOR_DATE (YYYY-MM-DD) is "today" in the demo world; screenshots freeze the
#   browser clock to the same date. Defaults to SEED_DEMO_ANCHOR, else the pinned
#   date below. Move it only for a full screenshot refresh.
# Requires: curl, jq. Auth is expected to be injected by your environment/proxy
# (no token is read or sent by this script). Override the endpoint only for testing
# via SEED_DEMO_API_BASE.
