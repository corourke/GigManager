## 3. Persona-Based Competitive Positioning

### 3.1 Rental Houses
**Best Current Competitor**: Rentman (dominant) / Current RMS (strong)
- Both offer deep warehouse workflows, barcode scanning, serialization, shortage alerts, and subrental management.
- **GigManager Gap**: No warehouse check-in/out workflow, no subrental management, no repairs tracking, no multiple warehouse locations. Asset management exists but is basic (list + kits).
- **What GigManager Can Offer**: Multi-tenant collaboration means rental houses can see what their clients (production companies) need without separate communication. This is a differentiator no competitor offers.

### 3.2 Sound & Lighting Companies
**Best Current Competitor**: Rentman (good fit) / LASSO (for crew-heavy ops)
- Rentman's combined crew + equipment scheduling is ideal. LASSO excels at crew logistics.
- **GigManager Gap**: No time tracking, no formal quoting/invoicing, limited crew management beyond basic slot assignment. No run-of-show or technical rider generation.
- **What GigManager Can Offer**: Multi-org collaboration means a sound company can see their assigned gigs from the production company's perspective, with shared participants. Hierarchical gigs let them see their role within a larger event. No competitor does this.

### 3.3 Bands / Acts
**Best Current Competitor**: None fit well (all are production/rental focused)
- Bands typically use general tools (BandHelper, Setlist.fm) or spreadsheets.
- **GigManager Gap**: No setlist management, no tour routing, no rider template management, no settlement workflow from the band's perspective.
- **What GigManager Can Offer**: Bands can see gigs they're participating in (as shared organizations), manage their own financials, and communicate with production companies — all within the same platform. This is a genuinely underserved market.

### 3.4 Production Companies / Event Producers
**Best Current Competitor**: LASSO (comprehensive) / Rentman (for equipment-heavy) / BackOpsLive (for day-of coordination)
- LASSO covers crew, inventory, financials, and event management end-to-end. BackOpsLive focuses on real-time execution.
- **GigManager Gap**: No formal quoting/invoicing, no vendor bid rollups, no run of show, no day-of tracking.
- **What GigManager Can Offer**: Hierarchical gig structure is a genuine differentiator — no competitor has this. Combined with multi-org collaboration, a producer can create a festival, assign stages to different sound companies, and have everyone see their piece. No other tool enables this workflow.

### 3.5 Venues
**Best Current Competitor**: None fit well (all are production/rental focused)
- Venues typically use booking-specific tools (Tripleseat, EventPro) or general calendar tools.
- **GigManager Gap**: No external booking portal, no multi-room calendar visualization, no house tech spec sharing workflow.
- **What GigManager Can Offer**: Venues can participate in gigs as shared organizations, seeing what production companies and acts are bringing. Hierarchical gigs naturally model multi-room events. This is underserved territory.

## 4. GigManager's Unique Differentiators

These are capabilities that **no competitor offers**:

### 4.1 Multi-Organization Collaboration (Built)
Every competitor operates as a silo — one company per account. GigManager's shared-organization, multi-tenant model means all event participants (producer, sound company, venue, band, rental house) can collaborate on the same gig while maintaining private data isolation via RLS. This is a fundamental architectural advantage.

### 4.2 Hierarchical Gig Structure (Planned)
No competitor natively models parent-child event relationships. Rentman and Current RMS use flat project structures. LASSO has project management but no hierarchical inheritance. GigManager's recursive inheritance model (participants, staff, equipment flowing from parent to child with override capability) is a unique value proposition for complex events.

### 4.3 Cross-Persona Platform (Planned)
Competitors focus on one persona: Rentman/Current RMS serve rental/production companies, LASSO serves crew-heavy operations, BackOpsLive serves day-of coordination. GigManager's multi-tenant architecture means it can serve all participants in the event ecosystem. No competitor attempts this.

### 4.4 Google Calendar Integration (Built)
None of the competitors offer direct Google Calendar sync. This is a small but meaningful differentiator for individual users managing their schedules.

---

## 5. Differentiation Opportunities — Where to Leapfrog

### 5.1 Collaborative Event Planning (High Priority)
Build on the multi-org architecture to create a genuinely collaborative planning experience:
- Shared timelines visible to all participants
- Cross-organization messaging within gig context
- Vendor bid comparison from the producer's perspective
- Real-time status updates visible to all participants

### 5.2 Hierarchical Financial Rollups (High Priority)
No competitor does financial aggregation across event hierarchies. GigManager can:
- Roll up costs from sub-gigs to parent events
- Show producers total event P&L across all vendors
- Enable settlement workflows that account for hierarchical billing

### 5.3 Persona-Adaptive UI (Medium Priority)
Dynamically adjust the interface based on organization type:
- Rental houses see warehouse and inventory features prominently
- Bands see schedule, settlement, and rider features
- Venues see booking calendar and tech specs
- Producers see the full suite with financial dashboards

### 5.4 Smart Import & Real-World Data Seeding (Medium Priority)
No competitor offers robust CSV import for gigs. Enhance asset import to match Rentman's import capabilities:
- Flexible column mapping
- Bulk update via serial number/barcode matching
- Kit/package import
- Organization import with relationship mapping

### 5.5 Offline-First PWA with Native Capabilities (Medium Priority)

**Competitor Mobile Benchmarks**:

| Capability | Rentman (Native) | Current RMS (Companion) | LASSO (Native) | GigManager Target (PWA) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Barcode scanning | Camera + Zebra hardware + RFID | Camera (QR + barcode) | Not prominent | Camera + Bluetooth HID scanners |
| Offline warehouse | ✅ Full offline scan/book | ❌ Online only | ❌ Online only | ✅ Full offline with IndexedDB queue |
| Crew schedule view | ✅ Call sheets, calendar sync | ❌ Web only | ✅ Accept invites, view schedule | ✅ Schedule, assignments, gig details |
| Push notifications | ✅ Native push | ❌ | ✅ Native push | ✅ Web Push API (VAPID) |
| Project creation | ✅ Create on mobile | ❌ Scan only | ❌ Crew-facing only | ✅ Full CRUD (responsive) |
| Offline data scope | Warehouse module only | None | None | All core data (gigs, assets, staff) |
| Scanner hardware support | Zebra, RFID readers | Basic camera | Not documented | Bluetooth HID (keyboard-emulating scanners) |

**Key Decisions for GigManager's PWA Approach**:
- **PWA vs. Native trade-off**: PWA avoids app store friction and works across all devices, but cannot match Rentman's Zebra scanner integration or RFID support. For high-volume rental houses (scanning 500+ items/day), Bluetooth HID scanners are the viable alternative.
- **Offline scope advantage**: Rentman only supports offline for warehouse operations. GigManager can differentiate by making gig schedules, staff assignments, and contact info available offline — critical for crew in the field at venues with poor connectivity.
- **Camera scanning performance**: JS-based barcode libraries (`zxing-js/browser`, `quagga2`) work well for 1D/2D codes in good lighting but struggle in dim warehouse environments. Consider requiring torch/flashlight activation and providing a manual entry fallback.
- **Sync conflict strategy**: Rentman doesn't document their offline sync strategy. GigManager should implement last-write-wins for simple fields with timestamp-based merge for array fields (participants, kit items). Display sync conflicts to user for manual resolution when detected.

---

## 6. Priority Recommendations for Roadmap

Based on this analysis, here are recommended adjustments to the sprint roadmap:

### Sprint 1: Data Foundations (unchanged)
- Enhanced asset CSV import (flexible mapping, bulk updates)
- Database schema for `parent_gig_id` and `hierarchy_depth`
- Backend recursive inheritance logic
- **Add**: Organization-type-aware UI scaffolding (persona-adaptive shell)

**Technical Feasibility**: Low-medium risk. The `parent_gig_id` schema change is straightforward. Recursive CTEs for inheritance are well-supported in PostgreSQL but must be carefully indexed — without an index on `parent_gig_id`, hierarchy queries degrade to O(n) table scans. The cycle-prevention trigger requires careful testing (inserting into a hierarchy while concurrent transactions modify it). CSV import enhancements are low risk — PapaParse is already in use.

### Sprint 2: Hierarchy UI & Collaboration (adjusted)
- Gig list hierarchy display with rollup statuses
- Progressive disclosure forms for parent/child gig creation
- **Add**: Cross-organization gig visibility enhancements (leverage existing multi-tenant)
- **Add**: Basic financial rollups across hierarchy (sum of child bids/expenses visible on parent)
- **Defer PWA to Sprint 3**: Hierarchy + collaboration is the differentiator; mobile is table-stakes that can follow

**Technical Feasibility**: Medium risk. The UI for expandable/collapsible hierarchical lists requires careful state management — especially with React's rendering model and the existing table component (which uses in-place editing). Financial rollups via recursive CTEs will need materialized views or caching for events with 20+ sub-gigs, as real-time aggregation across deep hierarchies could exceed the 200ms target. RLS policies must be extended to handle hierarchical access (parent access grants child access) without introducing N+1 query patterns.

### Sprint 3: Mobile PWA & Warehouse Basics (adjusted)
- Offline-first PWA baseline with service workers, manifest, touch-optimized layout
- Camera-based barcode scanning for equipment check-in/out
- Basic warehouse workflow (check-out to gig, check-in from gig)
- **Add**: Equipment shortage detection (parity with Rentman/Current RMS)

**Technical Feasibility**: High risk — this is the most technically complex sprint. Offline-first PWA requires a service worker strategy for caching Supabase responses, an IndexedDB-based local data store, and a robust conflict resolution mechanism for concurrent offline edits (last-write-wins vs. merge). Camera-based barcode scanning in a PWA relies on the MediaDevices API + a JS barcode decoding library (e.g., `zxing-js/browser`) — cross-browser compatibility varies and performance on older devices can be poor. Rentman solves this with a native app + Zebra scanner hardware support; PWA will not match that for high-volume warehouse operations. Consider supporting Bluetooth barcode scanners (which act as keyboard input) as a fallback.

### Sprint 4: Financial Management & Settlement (adjusted)
- **Add**: Formal quoting/proposal generation (competitive parity with Rentman/Current RMS/LASSO)
- Act-specific settlement screen
- Production vendor bid rollups across hierarchy
- Push notifications for assignments and hierarchy-aware gig updates
- Performance optimization & volume testing

**Technical Feasibility**: Medium risk. Quoting/invoicing is a large feature surface area — document generation, PDF export, branded templates, and potentially e-signature integration. Recommend starting with a minimal viable quote (line items + total + PDF export) rather than attempting Rentman-level document customization. Push notifications require a Supabase Edge Function for Web Push API (VAPID keys, subscription management). Volume testing (5k+ assets, 500+ hierarchical gigs) should be run early and continuously, not deferred to end of sprint.

### Future Sprints (identified from competitive analysis)
- Subrental management (Rentman parity)
- Repairs & maintenance tracking (Rentman/LASSO parity)
- Time tracking for crew (LASSO parity)
- Availability request workflow for staff (Rentman/LASSO parity)
- Run of show / rundown (LASSO/BackOpsLive parity)
- Document templates for branded proposals
- Public API for integrations
- Accounting system integrations (QuickBooks/Xero)
- Gig templates & presets

## 7. Strategic Summary

**GigManager's strongest competitive advantage is architectural**: multi-tenant collaboration + hierarchical events. No competitor has either, let alone both. The near-term strategy should focus on making these differentiators real, functional, and impressive — then layer on table-stakes features (mobile, financials, warehouse) to close competitive gaps.

**The biggest competitive risk is financial management**: every serious competitor has quoting, invoicing, and accounting integrations. GigManager currently has only basic bid tracking. This gap must be closed by Sprint 4 to be taken seriously by production companies and rental houses.

**The underserved personas (bands, venues) represent a go-to-market opportunity**: competitors largely ignore them. GigManager's multi-tenant model naturally serves these users. Even basic features (schedule visibility, settlement from the band's side, booking calendar for venues) would be differentiated.
