**At a glance**

| Concern | Answer |
|---|---|
| Web host | Cloudflare Pages, project `gigwrangler` |
| Domain | `gigwrangler.com` (HTTPS via Cloudflare) |
| DNS | Cloudflare — same account as Pages |
| Backend | Supabase project `hqnnhtxcxedisasvtbqv` (Pro plan) |
| Build tool | Vite 6 → `build/` |
| Deploy trigger | **Manual** — a human runs `./deploy_prod.sh` from `main` |
| Automated CD | **None.** GitHub Actions runs quality gates only, never deploys |
| Vercel / Netlify | **Not used.** Evaluated and rejected — see [Why Cloudflare Pages](#why-cloudflare-pages) |
| Staging environment | **None.** Two environments only: dev and prod |
| `website/index.html` | An unreleased marketing-page experiment. Deliberately not wired into the build and not deployed — ignore it when reasoning about production |

---

## The Production Deploy

Everything is orchestrated by [`deploy_prod.sh`](../../deploy_prod.sh) at the repo root. It is the authoritative runbook; this section explains what it does and why.

```bash
./deploy_prod.sh
```

The script mirrors all output to a timestamped log at `./backups/deploy-<timestamp>.log` for post-mortems.

### Stage 1 — Pre-flight gates (nothing is touched yet)

| Gate | Rationale |
|---|---|
| `git status --porcelain` is empty | You deploy what is committed, not what is on your disk |
| Current branch is `main` | Production only ever ships `main` |
| Local `HEAD == origin/main` | Prevents shipping a commit nobody else has seen, or missing one |
| CI concluded `success` for that exact SHA | Reuses the GitHub Actions run rather than trusting local state |
| `npm ci` | Installs from the lockfile, not whatever `node_modules` happens to hold |
| `npm run typecheck && lint && test:run` | Local belt to CI's braces |

All gates run **before** the Supabase CLI is linked to prod, so a gate failure never leaves the CLI pointed at production.

### Stage 2 — Target prod and confirm

Links to `hqnnhtxcxedisasvtbqv`, then **hard-verifies** the link by reading `supabase/.temp/project-ref` back and comparing. This is the ritual mandated by [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) — never trust that `supabase link` did what you asked. The script then prints pending migrations and requires the operator to type `deploy`.

### Stage 3 — Backups

Requires Docker (the script will start Docker Desktop on macOS and wait up to 60s). Two dumps land in `./backups/` (git-ignored):

- `prod-schema-backup-<timestamp>.sql` — `public` + `auth` schemas
- `prod-data-backup-<timestamp>.sql` — data only, `--use-copy`

Both are size-checked; an empty dump aborts the deploy before anything mutates.

### Stage 4 — Deploy, in this order

1. **Migrations** — `supabase db push --yes`
2. **Edge functions** — `supabase functions deploy`
3. **Frontend** — `npm run build` then `npx wrangler pages deploy build/ --project-name gigwrangler`

> **Migrations ship before code, which imposes a hard constraint:** every migration in a release must be backward-compatible with the *currently deployed* code. Expand-only — add nullable columns and new tables freely, but no drops, renames, or `NOT NULL` tightening in the same release as the code that depends on them. This ordering means a failed `db push` never leaves new code running against an old schema. Contracting changes go in a *follow-up* release, after the code that stopped using the old shape is live.

### Stage 5 — Smoke check

Polls `https://gigwrangler.com` up to 6 times (10s apart) for HTTP 200. A failure here is loud but late — the deploy has already completed, so the message tells you to verify production manually.

### Always — the exit trap

A single `trap ... EXIT` registered before any other logic guarantees that **every** exit path (success, `die`, a failed command under `set -e`, Ctrl-C) relinks the Supabase CLI back to dev. On failure it also reports blast radius: whether production was mutated, and the paths of both backups.

### Escape hatches

All opt-in, all documented in the script header. Use sparingly and know why:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `SKIP_CI_CHECK=1` | Skip the "CI is green for HEAD" gate |
| `SKIP_NPM_CI=1` | Reuse existing `node_modules` instead of `npm ci` |
| `SKIP_LOCAL_GATES=1` | Skip local typecheck/lint/tests (rely on CI green) |
| `SKIP_HEALTHCHECK=1` | Skip the post-deploy smoke check |
| `AUTO_CONFIRM=yes` | Skip the interactive confirmation prompt |
| `PROD_URL=<url>` | Override the smoke-check URL |

---

## Dev Deploys

[`deploy_dev.sh`](../../deploy_dev.sh) pushes migrations and edge functions to the **dev** Supabase project (`qcrzwsazasaojqoqxwnr`). It encodes the same link → hard-verify → deploy ritual, and its exit trap likewise guarantees the CLI is left on dev.

```bash
./deploy_dev.sh           # link, verify, db push, functions deploy
./deploy_dev.sh --check   # dry run: verify link, list pending migrations
                          # and functions, deploy nothing
```

No branch/cleanliness/test gates and no backups — dev is where unmerged work lands and its data is disposable. The script refuses to continue if the verified ref is prod or anything other than dev.

**There is no dev frontend deploy.** Dev frontend work runs locally via `npm run dev` against the dev Supabase project.

---

## Continuous Integration

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on every push and pull request to `main`:

1. `npm ci`
2. `npm run typecheck` — TypeScript strict mode
3. `npm run lint` — ESLint flat config
4. `npm run test:run` — full Vitest suite
5. `npm run build` — production Vite build

**CI never deploys.** Its only relationship to production is that `deploy_prod.sh` refuses to run unless CI concluded `success` for the exact commit being deployed.

No repository secrets are required: the build step uses obviously-fake placeholders for `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. The client validates only their *presence* at runtime, and nothing contacts Supabase during a build.

---

## Service Reference

### Cloudflare Pages

Hosts the built SPA, terminates HTTPS, serves the CDN, and owns the custom domain.

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Project name | `gigwrangler` |
| Build command | `npm run build` |
| Build output directory | `build` |
| Custom domain | `gigwrangler.com` |
| DNS | Cloudflare, same account |
| SPA routing | [`public/_redirects`](../../public/_redirects) → `/*  /index.html  200` |

`public/` is copied into `build/` verbatim by Vite, which is how `_redirects` reaches the deploy. Without it, Cloudflare returns 404 for every client-side route (`/gigs/123`, `/settings`, …) on hard refresh or deep link.

DNS for `gigwrangler.com` is managed in Cloudflare alongside the Pages project, so the custom domain binds without any external nameserver change and HTTPS is issued automatically. One account is therefore the single point of failure for hosting, DNS, and TLS — losing access to it takes the site down with no independent lever to recover.

Deploys are pushed from a developer machine with the Wrangler CLI:

```bash
npm run build
npx wrangler pages deploy build/ --project-name gigwrangler
```

**There is no committed `wrangler.toml`.** All Pages configuration — build settings, environment variables, custom domain — lives in the Cloudflare dashboard. See [Known Gaps](#known-gaps).

Environment variables are set in **dashboard → Settings → Environment variables**. Because Vite inlines `VITE_*` values at build time, **changing one requires a redeploy** to take effect. See the [Configuration Inventory](#configuration-inventory) for the full list.

#### Why Cloudflare Pages

Chosen over Vercel and Netlify during the original production bring-up:

- Free tier with unlimited bandwidth and no monthly build-minute cap (Netlify's free tier caps at 300 min/mo; Vercel enforces 100 GB bandwidth/mo)
- Native custom domains with automatic HTTPS via Cloudflare's CDN
- Manual deploys supported via `wrangler pages deploy` or dashboard upload

**Vercel is not part of this stack.** It appears in the repo only as a rejected alternative.

### Supabase

Provides Postgres, Auth, Storage, and Edge Functions. Two projects, no staging:

| Environment | Project Ref | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|
| Development | `qcrzwsazasaojqoqxwnr` | `npm run dev` via `.env.local` |
| Production | `hqnnhtxcxedisasvtbqv` | Cloudflare Pages via dashboard env vars |

> ⚠️ **Verify the linked project before ANY remote Supabase command.** `supabase db push`, `functions deploy`, and `secrets set` all act on whatever is linked, with no confirmation of their own.
>
> ```bash
> cat supabase/.temp/project-ref
> ```
>
> Both deploy scripts do this automatically. Do it by hand for one-off commands.

**Auth URL configuration** (dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration):
- Site URL: `https://gigwrangler.com`
- Redirect URLs include: `https://gigwrangler.com/**`

**Edge functions** deployed to prod: `server` (the consolidated API — users, organizations, gigs, dashboard, Google integrations, WebAuthn, email) and `ai-scan` (receipt/invoice extraction). `_shared/` holds CORS and Sentry helpers and is not itself a function.

**Backups** are two-layered:
- Supabase-managed: automated daily backups, and optionally PITR, configured in dashboard → Database → Backups
- Deploy-time: schema and data dumps into `./backups/` before every prod migration, taken by `deploy_prod.sh`

### Vite

The build tool. [`vite.config.ts`](../../vite.config.ts) configures:

- `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` and the Tailwind v4 Vite plugin
- `vite-plugin-pwa` with `registerType: 'autoUpdate'`, workbox `skipWaiting` + `clientsClaim`, and a `navigateFallbackAllowlist` of `/^(?!\/api\/).*/` so every client-side react-router route falls back to `index.html` instead of being rejected by the service worker
- `build.outDir: 'build'`, `build.target: 'esnext'`
- `define.__BUILD_TIMESTAMP__` — injected at build time and used as the Sentry release identifier

Environment variables must be prefixed `VITE_` to be exposed to client code, and are **inlined at build time** — they are not runtime configuration. [`src/utils/supabase/info.tsx`](../../src/utils/supabase/info.tsx) throws on startup if `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` or `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is missing, which turns a misconfigured deploy into an immediate visible failure rather than silent connection to the wrong database.

### Sentry

Error monitoring across three surfaces. **All three no-op when their DSN env var is unset**, so local dev and tests are unaffected.

| Surface | Init location | Env vars |
|---|---|---|
| Web app | [`src/main.tsx`](../../src/main.tsx) — `Sentry.init` + top-level `Sentry.ErrorBoundary` | `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` |
| `server` edge function | [`supabase/functions/_shared/sentry.ts`](../../supabase/functions/_shared/sentry.ts), captured in the top-level catch | `SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` |
| `ai-scan` edge function | same shared helper | `SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` |

The web app tags events with `environment` (Vite mode) and `release` (`gigwrangler@<build timestamp>`), and sets `sendDefaultPii: false`. Edge functions flush explicitly before responding, because Deno isolates can terminate the moment a response is returned. The Sentry Deno import is version-pinned so `functions deploy` is reproducible.

**Two Sentry projects, two DSNs** — one per runtime. A **JavaScript React** project for the web app, and a **Deno** project for the edge functions. Each DSN comes from its own project's **Settings → Client Keys (DSN)**, and looks like `https://abc123@o123456.ingest.sentry.io/789`.

#### Activating it

**Web app** — add `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` (React project DSN) in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard → Settings → Environment variables → Production. It is baked into the bundle at build time, so **a new deploy is required** before it takes effect; run `./deploy_prod.sh`. Do not put it in `.env.production.local` — that file is local-only and never reaches the deploy.

**Edge functions** — use the Deno project DSN:

```bash
cat supabase/.temp/project-ref   # verify the target first
supabase secrets set SENTRY_DSN="https://…" SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT="production"
```

Secrets take effect immediately; no function redeploy is needed. Without `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`, events default to `development` and get filtered out of production dashboards — which looks identical to Sentry not working.

#### Verifying

On the deployed site, open DevTools → Network and filter for `sentry.io`; a session request should appear within seconds. `window.__SENTRY__` being defined in the console confirms init. For a real end-to-end check, run `throw new Error("Sentry test — delete me")` in the console and confirm it lands in **Issues** within ~30s, then delete it.

#### What is and isn't captured

Captured: React render errors via the `ErrorBoundary`, unhandled rejections and uncaught exceptions (auto-instrumented), and every unhandled throw in both edge functions.

Deliberately **not** captured: expected HTTP errors returned as responses (401, 403, 429) — they are returned, not thrown; performance traces (`tracesSampleRate: 0` on edge functions); and PII (`sendDefaultPii: false`).

#### Known limitation — no source maps

Stack traces point at minified filenames (`index-XXXXXXXX.js`) rather than real source locations, which makes production errors materially harder to read. Fixing it means adding [`@sentry/vite-plugin`](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/uploading/vite/) to `vite.config.ts` and providing a `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` at build time.

### Google

Three separate integrations, each with its own credentials.

**1. Google OAuth (sign-in)** — configured entirely in Supabase, not in app code.
- Google Cloud Console: OAuth consent screen (External) + OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web Application)
- Authorized redirect URI: `https://hqnnhtxcxedisasvtbqv.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
- Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Google: enable, paste Client ID + Secret

**2. Google Places API (New)** — address search and place details in the `server` function.
- Google Cloud API key with "Places API (New)" enabled
- Edge function secret: `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`

**3. Google Calendar** — gig sync, OAuth 2.0 with a token exchange in the edge function.
- Google Calendar API enabled; OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web Application)
- Authorized JavaScript origins: `http://localhost:3000`, `https://gigwrangler.com`
- Authorized redirect URIs: `http://localhost:3000/auth/google-calendar/callback`, `https://gigwrangler.com/auth/google-calendar/callback`
- Frontend build-time var: `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- Edge function secrets: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

> **Support note:** OAuth scope and per-calendar sharing are independent permission layers. A user can be "Connected" with a calendar selected while holding only *read* access on it, and every sync then fails with `403 / "You need to have writer access to this calendar."` The picker only offers calendars Google reports as `writer` or `owner`, but cannot fix sharing that was never granted. Full detail in [setup-guide.md](./setup-guide.md#3-google-calendar-integration).

### Anthropic

The `ai-scan` edge function uses Claude to extract structured data from invoices and receipts.

- Edge function secret: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- PDF scanning requires a **Tier 1+** Anthropic account; Tier 0 supports images only and the UI falls back to manual entry
- Connectivity diagnostic: `POST /functions/v1/ai-scan` with header `x-diagnostic: true`

### Resend

Transactional email (organization invitations) from the `server` function, via a raw `fetch` rather than an SDK.

- Edge function secrets: `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`
- **Both are set in dev and prod, and delivery is confirmed working.**
- Sends are **best-effort**: if `RESEND_API_KEY` is unset the call logs a warning and returns `{ sent: false }` rather than failing the request that triggered it. An unconfigured environment drops invitation emails silently — which is why `RESEND_API_KEY` belongs on any post-deploy verification pass.
- `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` must stay set. Its code fallback in [`lib/email.ts`](../../supabase/functions/server/lib/email.ts) is `GigManager <onboarding@resend.dev>` — Resend's sandbox sender, which only delivers to the account owner's verified address, and which still carries the pre-rebrand name. Unsetting the secret would therefore both break delivery and regress branding, with no error.

### WebAuthn / passkeys

The `server` function's passkey routes read relying-party config from [`supabase/functions/server/lib/webauthnConfig.ts`](../../supabase/functions/server/lib/webauthnConfig.ts), which **defaults to localhost values**:

```ts
export const RP_NAME = Deno.env.get('RP_NAME')  || 'GigWrangler';
export const RP_ID   = Deno.env.get('RP_ID')    || 'localhost';
export const ORIGIN  = Deno.env.get('ORIGIN')   || 'http://localhost:3000';
```

> ⚠️ In production `RP_ID` must be `gigwrangler.com` and `ORIGIN` must be `https://gigwrangler.com`. If they are left at their defaults, registration and authentication fail origin/RPID validation — **passkeys break with no startup error and no deploy-time warning.** These are the only production secrets whose absence degrades a feature silently rather than loudly.

---

## Configuration Inventory

Derived from the code that actually reads each value, not from any prior checklist. This is the definitive list.

### Frontend — build-time (`VITE_*`)

Set in **Cloudflare Pages → Settings → Environment variables**. Inlined by Vite at build time; **a change requires a redeploy.**

| Variable | Required | Read by | Effect if missing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | **Yes** | `src/utils/supabase/info.tsx` | App throws on startup |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | **Yes** | `src/utils/supabase/info.tsx` | App throws on startup |
| `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | For Calendar | Calendar integration components | Google Calendar connect flow unavailable |
| `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` | Optional | `src/main.tsx` | Sentry no-ops; no error reporting |

Local equivalents live in `.env.local` (git-ignored). [`.env.example`](../../.env.example) documents the shape with placeholder values.

### Edge functions — Supabase secrets

Set with `supabase secrets set NAME=VALUE` against the **verified** target project. List with `supabase secrets list`.

| Secret | Required | Used by | Effect if missing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` | For address search | `server` → places routes | Place search returns errors |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | For Calendar | `server` → calendar token exchange | Calendar OAuth fails |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | For Calendar | `server` → calendar token exchange | Calendar OAuth fails |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | For AI scan | `ai-scan` | Receipt/invoice scanning fails |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | For email | `server` → `lib/email.ts` | **Silent** — invitation emails skipped |
| `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` | For real delivery | `server` → `lib/email.ts` | Falls back to Resend sandbox sender |
| `RP_ID` | **Yes in prod** | `server` → webauthn | **Silent** — defaults to `localhost`, passkeys break |
| `ORIGIN` | **Yes in prod** | `server` → webauthn | **Silent** — defaults to `http://localhost:3000`, passkeys break |
| `RP_NAME` | Optional | `server` → webauthn | Defaults to `GigWrangler` (correct) |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Optional | `_shared/sentry.ts` | Sentry no-ops in functions |
| `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` | Optional | `_shared/sentry.ts` | Defaults to `development` — set to `production` |

`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are **injected automatically by the Supabase platform**. Do not set them by hand.

Audit both projects with:

```bash
cat supabase/.temp/project-ref   # confirm which project you are looking at
supabase secrets list
```

### Audit results — 2026-09-08

**`RP_ID`, `ORIGIN` and `RP_NAME` are absent from prod.** Passkey registration and authentication have therefore been running against the code defaults (`localhost`, `http://localhost:3000`) in production, which fail WebAuthn's origin and RPID validation. Fix:

```bash
supabase secrets set RP_ID=gigwrangler.com ORIGIN=https://gigwrangler.com
```

They are absent from dev too, and should stay that way — the `localhost` defaults are correct there, since the dev project is only ever reached from a local dev server. That asymmetry is exactly why this went unnoticed: passkeys work locally and fail only in production, silently.

`ORIGIN` is a single exact-match string, so passkeys will not work on Cloudflare Pages preview URLs (`*.pages.dev`) even after the fix. `RP_ID` is a registrable domain suffix, so it does cover subdomains of `gigwrangler.com`.

Three further observations from the same audit:

| Finding | Assessment |
|---|---|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` and `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` have **identical digests in dev and prod** — one Resend key and sender shared by both | Test sends from dev leave as production-branded mail, count against the same quota, and affect the same domain sending reputation. Worth splitting into a separate dev key. |
| `SENTRY_DSN` is **shared** across dev and prod, but `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` **differs** | Correct as-is. This is Sentry's intended pattern: one project, environments separated by tag rather than by DSN. |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` exists on **dev only**, with the same digest as that project's `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`, and is read nowhere in the codebase | Orphan. Safe to unset: `supabase secrets unset GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` against dev. |

## Rollback and Recovery

### Frontend rollback

Cloudflare Pages keeps every deployment. Roll back in **dashboard → Deployments → (a previous build) → Rollback**. This is instant and requires no local tooling — the fastest lever when a bad frontend ships.

Note that a rollback restores the *frontend only*. If the bad release also migrated the database, see below.

### Database rollback

There is no automatic down-migration. Recovery options, in order of preference:

1. **Roll forward** — write a corrective migration. Almost always right for a schema mistake.
2. **Supabase PITR**, *if enabled* — dashboard → Database → Backups.

   **PITR (Point-In-Time Recovery)** continuously archives the database's write-ahead log, so you can restore to *any moment* inside a retention window — "09:42, just before the bad migration" — rather than only to the last nightly snapshot. Without it, the worst case is losing up to a full day of writes; with it, roughly the last few minutes.

   It is a **paid add-on** on top of Pro, not something Pro includes, so it is off unless someone deliberately turned it on. **Whether it is enabled for this project has not been confirmed** — check the dashboard before relying on this step. If it is off, the deploy-time dumps below are the only fine-grained recovery path, and they only exist for migrations run through `deploy_prod.sh`.
3. **Deploy-time dumps** — `./backups/prod-schema-backup-<ts>.sql` and `prod-data-backup-<ts>.sql`, taken immediately before the migrations that shipped.

Restoring a data-only dump trips foreign-key checks, because rows are inserted in dump order rather than dependency order. Wrap the import:

```sql
SET session_replication_role = 'replica';
-- [dump contents]
SET session_replication_role = 'origin';
```

### Edge function rollback

Redeploy from an earlier commit:

```bash
git checkout <good-sha>
cat supabase/.temp/project-ref   # verify prod before proceeding
supabase functions deploy
git checkout main
```

## Rebuilding Production From Scratch

The one-time bring-up, should production ever need to be recreated. This section is now the authoritative version; it was originally executed as `.zenflow/tasks/production-setup-b686/`, a historical artifact of the retired Zenflow tooling that is kept only for provenance and may be deleted without loss.

**1. Supabase project**
- Create a project on the **Pro plan**; note the new ref and DB password. PITR is a separate paid add-on on top of Pro — enable it deliberately if you want sub-daily recovery
- `supabase link --project-ref <new-ref>` → verify → `supabase db push`
- `supabase functions deploy`
- Set the secrets. The three site-identity values are not credentials and are the same on every rebuild, so they can be pasted verbatim — the rest come from their respective service dashboards:

  ```bash
  cat supabase/.temp/project-ref   # verify the target before every secrets command

  # Site identity — WebAuthn relying party. Fixed values; no secret to look up.
  # Omitting these is silent: the code falls back to localhost defaults and
  # passkeys fail in production with no error anywhere.
  supabase secrets set \
    RP_ID=gigwrangler.com \
    ORIGIN=https://gigwrangler.com \
    RP_NAME=GigWrangler

  # Third-party credentials — fetch each from its own console
  supabase secrets set \
    GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=… \
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=… \
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=… \

  ```

  `RP_NAME` is included even though its code default is already correct, so that every value the relying party depends on is explicit in one place rather than half-configured and half-inherited.

- Authentication → URL Configuration: Site URL `https://gigwrangler.com`, redirect `https://gigwrangler.com/**`
- Authentication → Providers → Google: enable, paste Client ID + Secret
- Database → Backups: confirm daily backups are active and note the retention window; enable PITR if sub-daily recovery is wanted

**2. Google Cloud Console**
- OAuth consent screen (External)
- OAuth 2.0 Client ID with the origins and redirect URIs listed under [Google](#google)
- Enable Places API (New) and Google Calendar API; issue the Places API key

**3. Cloudflare Pages**
- Create project `gigwrangler`; build command `npm run build`, output directory `build`
- Add all four `VITE_*` variables from the [inventory](#frontend--build-time-vite_)
- Add custom domain `gigwrangler.com`; verify HTTPS is active. DNS is already managed in the same Cloudflare account, so no external nameserver change is needed and the certificate issues automatically

**4. First deploy**
- Update `PROD_REF` in both `deploy_prod.sh` and `deploy_dev.sh` if the ref changed
- `./deploy_prod.sh`

**5. Verify**
- `https://gigwrangler.com` loads; tab title reads "GigWrangler"
- Sign-in completes and the user appears in the prod Supabase dashboard → Auth → Users
- A deep link (e.g. `https://gigwrangler.com/gigs`) survives a hard refresh — confirms `_redirects` shipped
- Passkey registration succeeds — confirms `RP_ID` / `ORIGIN` are set
- An organization invitation email arrives — confirms Resend
- A deliberate client error appears in Sentry

## Known Gaps

Tracked here rather than lost. None of these block a deploy today; all of them would slow down an incident or a rebuild.

| Gap | Impact |
|---|---|
| **Cloudflare dashboard config is not in the repo** — no `wrangler.toml`, no record of which env vars are actually set | Rebuilding the Pages project means reconstructing settings from this doc and hoping it is current. Drift between dashboard and doc is undetectable. |
| **`RP_ID` / `ORIGIN` missing from prod** — confirmed 2026-09-08 | Passkeys are broken in production and produce no error anywhere. Fix in [Audit results](#audit-results--2026-09-08). |
| **Dev and prod share one Resend key and sender** | Dev test sends go out as production-branded mail on the same quota and sending reputation |
| **Single-account blast radius** — hosting, DNS, and TLS all live in one Cloudflare account | Loss of access to that account takes the site down with no independent recovery path |
| **No staging environment** | Migrations are first exercised against production data during the prod deploy itself. Dev is the only rehearsal, and its data is not representative. |
| **No automated CD** | Every production release depends on one person with a working local toolchain, Docker running, and `gh` authenticated |
| **Prod PITR and retention not confirmed** | The rollback procedure offers PITR as an option without anyone having verified it is switched on. PITR is a paid add-on, so the default answer is "off". |
